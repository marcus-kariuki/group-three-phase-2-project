# DIMBA.org

Welcome to the DIMBA.org, where a user"manager" can see and vet players available for transfer either on loan or for sale.
This project was inspired by the current football transfer trends in the January transfer window. 



## Setup

Make sure to open
[Dimba.org](https://group-three-phase-2-project.vercel.app/)


## Core Deliverables

As a user/manager, I should be able to:

- See a list of the available players.
- Fill out and submit the form to add a new player for transfer. This should add the new
  player to the list **as well as post the new player to the backend
  API for persistence**.
- Filter players by typing into the search bar. Only players with a
  description matching the search term should be shown in the players list.

### Endpoints for Core Deliverables

#### GET /players

#### POST `/players`
